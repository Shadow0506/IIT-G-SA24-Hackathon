# Week-3-Hackathon
My goal is to predict how likely individuals are to receive their xyz and seasonal flu vaccines. Specifically, I'll be predicting two probabilities: one for xyz_vaccine and one for seasonal_vaccine.

"Submission" file contains the predictions done on the test data.
"final_model.pkl" is the exported model which is trained in the Final.ipynb notebook.
